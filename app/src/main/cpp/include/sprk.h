	* <em>\htmlonly Component \endhtmlonly</em>\n
	* Removes this component from memory and invalidates any component objects referring to it. All owners of this component will no longer have it as a
	* subcomponent, all components that reference this component will no longer have it as a reference, and the keys underlying this component will be deleted.
	* Any subcomponents of this component that have multiple owners will have this component removed as an owner.  Any subcomponents of this component that
	* have only this component as an owner will be recursively deleted via this function.
	*
	* Invoking this function on an instance of an object derived from Component will perform some additional cleanup relevant to the derived type.
	* For example, performing a delete on a CADModel will delete the default capture associated with the CADModel, delete its associated Model, and delete the
	* mapping information between keys and components, in addition to performing all the operations for a generic component. See below for the behavior of 
	* derived types in the integrations that create component trees.
	*
	* Lastly, note that it is not necessary to construct or cast a component to its specific type to ensure the appropriate delete logic is used. The appropriate
	* logic will always be invoked even if using a base Component object handle to a derived type.
	*
	* <b>Exchange:</b>
	*
	* <em>\htmlonly Component, ProductOccurrence, Sheet, Capture, Filter \endhtmlonly </em>\n
	* Invoking delete on these types will not modify the associated Exchange data. It will remove the associated A3DEntity pointer and component from the mapping
	* data accessible via Exchange::CADModel::GetComponentFromEntity, and then it will invoke the base Component delete logic.
	*
	* <em>\htmlonly CADModel \endhtmlonly </em>\n
	* Invoking delete on an Exchange::CADModel will delete the underlying A3DAsmModelFile via A3DAsmModelFileDelete <b>if</b> Exchange::CADModel::GetEntityOwnership is
	* true.  It will additionally clean up the associated A3DRWParamsPrcReadHelper if one was created during import (see Exchange::ImportOptionsKit::SetPRCReadHelper).
	* The mapping data between A3DEntity pointers and components will also be deleted, and lastly it will invoke the delete logic for the base CADModel.
	*
	* <b>Parasolid:</b>
	* 
	* <em>\htmlonly Component \endhtmlonly </em>\n
	* Invoking delete on this type will invoke PK_ENTITY_delete on the underlying Parasolid entity if the entity has class PK_CLASS_assembly or PK_CLASS_body. 
	* It will remove this Parasolid entity and component from the mapping data accessible via Parasolid::CADModel::GetComponentFromEntity,

	*
	* <em>\htmlonly CADModel \endhtmlonly </em>\n

	*
	* <b>DWG:</b>

    *   </ul>
    *
    *   In any case, if the function fails, it will return an empty Component, so checking if the type of the returned component is <span class='code'>None</span> or not can be considered a way to test if the function succeeded or failed.
    *    
    *   Additional notes about the deep copy process: The deep copy process for ProductOccurrence and RepresentationItem uses two functions of Exchange: <span class='code'>A3DAsmProductOccurrenceDeepCopy</span> and <span class='code'>A3DRiRepresentationItemDeepCopy</span>. These functions can make changes to the structure of the entity, so we may not have a copy that is an exact replica of the source entity. More on this can be found here: https://docs.techsoft3d.com/exchange/latest/build/group__a3d__productoccurrence.html#ga4923ada4d2d9d04466b6213c66a2d62c and https://docs.techsoft3d.com/exchange/latest/build/group__a3d__ricontent.html#gac1eb0015f2b9601689a03112a0db2004 
    *    
    *   For PartDefinition and RepresentationItemSet, which lack a deep copy function in Exchange, the PartDefinition is only shallow copied, so its children pointers are shared between the source and the target. The deep copy process copies all the attributes of the source entity, thus, if the modelling matrix of the source entity if relative to its parents, the location of the copied entity will also be relative to its new parents.
