Each instance of the operator supports inserting and interacting with a single cutting plane.

The cutting plane associated with an instance of the operator will be removed when the operator is popped from the View’s operator stack.</p>

 The MarkupOperator class defines an operator which allows the user to insert mark-up text and geometry. 
 This Operator works for both mouse- and touch-driven devices. 
 The markup created through this operator will be deleted when the operator is popped from the View.
 
 The MarkupOperator allows users to add the following markup types:
 - Freehand: 
	For mouse driven devices, click and move the mouse to draw freehand markup.
	For touch driven devices, touch down and move your finger to draw freehand markup

 - Text:
	For mouse driven devices, click where you want to place text. Type with the keyboard and click elsewhere when
	you are done inserting the note.
	For touch driven devices, tap where you want to place text. Use the software keyboard to type, and hide the
	keyboard when you are done inserting the note.
    When inserting text markup on touch devices, the view will shift while inserting text, to allow you to always
    see the text you are inserting. The view will reset smoothly once you hide the keyboard.

 - Circle:
	For mouse driven devices, click where you want to place the circle. Move the mouse while holding down the button 
	associated with the operator to change the radius of the circle.
	For touch driven devices, there are two options available for inserting circle markups:
		a. tap where you want to place the circle and move your finger to change the circle radius
		b. tap with two fingers. Move and pinch with the fingers to change the position and radius of the circle

 - Rectangle:
	For mouse driven devices, click where you want to place the top left corner of the rectangle, Move the mouse while holding
	down the button associated with the operator to change the position of the bottom right corner of the rectangle.
	For touch driven devices, there are two options available for inserting rectangle markups:
		a. tap where you want to place the top left corner of the rectangle and move your finger to change the position of the bottom right corner.
		b. tap with two fingers. Move and pinch with the fingers to change the position and size of the rectangle.

	On devices with a keyboard, pressing Escape will delete the markup currently being inserted.
	An event of type MarkupInsertedEvent in injected after a markup is inserted.
